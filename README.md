# Virtual Gesture Keyboard üñêÔ∏è‚å®Ô∏è

This project transforms simple hand gestures, detected via your mobile phone's camera (acting as an IP camera), into "Space" and "Backspace" key presses. It's a fun and practical way to demonstrate real-time computer vision using OpenCV and Python. ‚ú®

## üöÄ Features

*   **Color-Based Object Detection:** Identifies specific objects by their color in a live camera feed.
*   **Gesture Control:** Maps the detection of two colored objects to "Space" and "Backspace" key presses.
*   **Customizable:** Easily change the colors and objects by adjusting HSV color ranges.
*   **Cross-Platform:** Simulates key presses reliably across different operating systems with `pynput`.
*   **Mobile Camera Support:** Uses an IP Webcam app to enable your phone's camera for input.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

Before you start, ensure you have Python and the necessary libraries installed.

### Prerequisites

1.  **Python 3.x:** Download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Required Libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python pynput
    ```
    *   **Linux Users:** You might need `xorg-dev` or `libxkbcommon-dev`. Install using your package manager (e.g., `sudo apt-get install xorg-dev`).
    *   **macOS Users:** You may need to grant accessibility permissions to your terminal or IDE in `System Preferences` > `Security & Privacy` > `Accessibility`.
3.  **Android Phone with "IP Webcam" App:**
    *   Download it from the Google Play Store. This app streams your phone's camera feed over Wi-Fi.
    *   **Important:** Your phone and computer must be on the **same Wi-Fi network**.

### Calibration Steps (Crucial! üëÄ)

This project works best with correct HSV color range calibration and stable lighting.

1.  **Prepare Your Objects:** Choose two distinct, vividly colored physical objects. I've set this up to use:
    *   **Object for SPACE:** A **Dark Blue** object
    *   **Object for BACKSPACE:** A **Black** object

2.  **Calibrate HSV Color Ranges (Absolutely Vital! üåà)**
    The effectiveness of color detection greatly relies on defining the right HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) ranges for your objects.

    *   **Process:**
        1.  **Launch your IP Webcam app** on your phone and start the server. Open the shown URL (e.g., `http://192.168.1.100:8080`) in your computer's web browser. This displays the live stream from your phone.
        2.  **Hold your "Dark Blue" object** in front of your phone's camera, under the exact lighting you'll use for the virtual keyboard.
        3.  **Take a screenshot** of your object from the live browser feed.
        4.  **Use an online HSV color picker** (search "online HSV color picker from image") and upload your screenshot. Sample the color of your object to find its HSV values.
        5.  **Update `LOWER_DARK_BLUE` and `UPPER_DARK_BLUE`** in `virtual_keyboard_vision_colors.py`. Start with a tight range around the found values; expand the `Value` (brightness) component if lighting varies slightly.
        6.  **Repeat for your "Black" object**, updating `LOWER_BLACK` and `UPPER_BLACK`. Remember that black usually has very low `Value` and `Saturation`.

    *   **Why this is vital:** Small changes in lighting or object color can disrupt detection if your ranges are too narrow.

3.  **Configure `virtual_keyboard_vision_colors.py`:**
    *   Open the script in your text editor.
    *   **`mobile_camera_url`:** Update this variable with the exact URL from your IP Webcam app (e.g., `http://100.69.107.72:8080/video`).
    *   **`MIN_CONTOUR_AREA`:** Adjust this if very small color specks are detected.
    *   **`DETECTION_STABILITY_FRAMES`:** Increase this (e.g., to `20` or `25`) if the detection is too sensitive or flickering, requiring the object to be stable for more frames.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.  Open your terminal or command prompt.
2.  Navigate to your `Virtual-Gesture-Keyboard` project directory.
3.  Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python virtual_keyboard_vision_colors.py
    ```
4.  A live camera feed window will appear. üëÄ
5.  Hold your colored objects (Dark Blue for Space, Black for Backspace) in front of the camera to activate commands.
6.  Press `q` on your keyboard to close the application.

## üîç Troubleshooting Tips

*   **Camera Connection Issues ("Error: Could not open video stream...")**:
    *   Verify `mobile_camera_url` is correct.
    *   Ensure your phone and computer are on the **same Wi-Fi network**.
    *   Confirm the IP Webcam app is running and its server is active.
    *   Check your computer's firewall; it might be blocking the stream.

*   **Objects Not Detecting / Flickering Detections:**
    *   **Recalibrate HSV Ranges:** This is crucial for color detection. Be very precise!
    *   **Consistent Lighting:** Stable, even lighting is essential. Avoid shadows or changing light sources. üí°
    *   **`cv2.GaussianBlur` Kernel:** Experiment with the kernel size (e.g., `(9,9)` or `(11,11)`) in the script for more effective smoothing, which can reduce noise.
    *   **Morphological Operations (`erode`, `dilate` iterations):** Try increasing the `iterations` (e.g., to `3` or `4`) for these operations in the script to clean up the masks better.
    *   **Increase `DETECTION_STABILITY_FRAMES`:** This requires the object to be stable for more frames before recognizing a key press, reducing sensitivity to brief flickers.
